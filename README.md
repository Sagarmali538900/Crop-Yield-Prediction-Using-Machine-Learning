# Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates how to predict crop yield based on agricultural features using machine-learning models.

---

## 🌾 What This Notebook Does

* Loads and explores crop dataset
* Preprocesses features (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
* Trains machine-learning models for crop yield prediction
* Evaluates performance using accuracy/metrics
* Provides insights for agricultural decision-making

---

## 📁 Files

* `crop23.ipynb` — complete ML workflow
* Dataset file (CSV) — required for running the notebook

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook crop23.ipynb
```

Be sure your dataset path is correct or place the CSV in the same directory.
